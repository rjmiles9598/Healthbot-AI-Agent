# Healthbot-AI-Agent

A leading healthcare technology company that provides software solutions to hospitals and clinics worldwide is looking to innovate in the field of patient education and engagement, recognizing that well-informed patients lead to better health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.

# The Challenge: 
The healthcare company has identified a critical gap in patient education. Many patients struggle to understand their medical conditions, treatment options, and post-treatment care instructions. This lack of understanding can lead to poor adherence to treatment plans, unnecessary hospital readmissions, and overall poorer health outcomes

# This project:
You've been tasked with developing a prototype for an AI-powered "HealthBot" that can provide personalized, on-demand health information to patients. This chatbot should be able to answer patient queries, provide summarized medical information, and assess patient understanding through simple quizzes.

# Goals & Impact:
The HealthBot prototype aims to:

1) Improve patient understanding of medical conditions and treatments.
2) Provide 24/7 access to reliable health information.
3) Reduce the workload on healthcare providers for basic patient education.
4) Improve patient engagement and empowerment in their own healthcare.
5) Potentially reduce hospital readmissions and improve treatment adherence.

If successful, this prototype could be expanded into a full-fledged product offering by MediTech Solutions, revolutionizing patient education in healthcare facilities worldwide.
