A heart attack happens when something blocks the blood flow to your heart so it can’t get the oxygen it needs. ## Heart Attack Symptoms. **What does a heart attack feel like?**. When your blood supply is blocked, you have a heart attack. This tear can lead to a blood clot or sections of torn tissue blocking the artery, causing a heart attack. As a result, this clot interferes with the normal flow of blood through the affected artery leading to a heart attack. ## What Do I Do if I Have a Heart Attack? ## What Do I Do When Someone Else Has a Heart Attack? * Aspirin to stop blood clotting that may make the heart attack worse. You can still have another heart attack. **Why do I need to take medications after a heart attack?**.
