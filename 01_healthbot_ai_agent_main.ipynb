It happens most often in **scuba divers**, but can also affect people who work in pressurized environments (like caissons or tunnels) or who experience sudden pressure changes.\\n\\n### What it is\\nWhen you’re under higher pressure (underwater), more **nitrogen dissolves in your blood and tissues**. If you come up (ascend) **too fast**, that dissolved nitrogen can form **bubbles** in your body instead of being safely breathed out.  \\nThose bubbles can damage tissues and block blood flow.\\n\\n### Common symptoms\\nSymptoms usually start **within minutes to a few hours** after surfacing, but can be delayed up to 24 hours:\\n\\n- **Joint or limb pain** (especially shoulders, elbows, knees) – classic “bends”\\n- **Tingling, numbness, or weakness** in arms or legs\\n- **Dizziness, confusion, trouble walking, or balance problems**\\n- **Chest pain, coughing, or trouble breathing**\\n- **Severe fatigue or feeling “off”**\\n- **Skin rash, itching, or marbling (mottled) skin**\\n- **Bladder or bowel trouble**\\n\\nEven mild symptoms after a dive can be serious.\\n\\n### What to do if you suspect “the bends”\\nThis is **urgent**. If you recently dove or were in a pressurized environment and have any of the above:\\n\\n1. **Stop diving immediately.**\\n2. **Call emergency services** or go to the **nearest emergency department**.\\n3.

This:\\n  - Shrinks nitrogen bubbles\\n  - Forces nitrogen back into solution so it can be removed safely\\n  - Improves oxygen delivery to damaged tissues\\n\\nThe sooner it’s started, the better the outcome.\\n\\n### How to prevent it (for divers)\\n- Follow **dive tables or your dive computer**.\\n- Make **slow, controlled ascents**.\\n- Do **safety stops** (e.g., 3–5 minutes at 5 m / 15 ft).\\n- Avoid **flying or high altitude for at least 12–24 hours** after diving (longer after multiple or deep dives).\\n- Stay **well hydrated** and avoid heavy alcohol before and after diving.\\n- Avoid diving with **cold, exhaustion, illness**, or heavy exertion after the dive.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you tell me:\\n- Whether you **recently dove** or were in a **pressurized environment**, and  \\n- What **symptoms** (if any) you’re having and when they began,\\n\\nI can help you figure out how urgent this might be and what to do next.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 700, 'prompt_tokens': 239, 'total_tokens': 939, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 55, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-5.1-2025-11-13', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-D0hRbIxNKfR2a9Sk5b6oQxdN2ibvS', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--019be427-c659-72d3-b27d-eef68bd9ff22-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 239, 'output_tokens': 700, 'total_tokens': 939, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 55}}), AIMessage(content='Decompression sickness, or the bends, happens when nitrogen bubbles form in your blood and tissues after rapid pressure loss occurrence.  \\nIt most often affects scuba divers, but workers in pressurized environments or anyone with sudden pressure changes can be affected.\\n\\nSymptoms usually start within minutes to hours after surfacing and can be delayed up to 24 hours in some cases.  \\nCommon signs include joint or limb pain, tingling or numbness, dizziness, chest pain, breathing trouble, fatigue, and skin changes often.\\n\\nIf you suspect DCS, it is urgent.
